tkinter  # Usually comes with Python
# use the updated version of each and everyone except numpy if necessary
# Note: tkinter is typically included with Python installations, so it may not need to be installed separately.
# If you need to install tkinter separately, you can use:
# sudo apt-get install python3-tk
# or
# sudo apt install python3-tk
# if it still shows module error run the requirement-2 file
